I am incredibly surprised that the name wasn't already taken...

This is a full-stack application. I build a React -> Rails -> Postgres app in the hope of standing out as a candidate. I completed all features of the design specs, with a few exceptions: 

1. I couldn't tie down the specific proportions of the boxes, so I had to make estimtes.
2. I couldn't figure out how to make the color inputs have a border of gray when selected, so I settled for just giving them the gray border when hovering over them. The affordance to the user that the color has changed is instead signaled by the change in the forms top border color, which immediately changes to match their selection.
